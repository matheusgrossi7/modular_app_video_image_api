# test_modular_app_video_image_api
A Flutter project created with the goal of put some concepts learned into practice. The app will display videos and image from Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/), using [their API](https://www.pexels.com/api/).

Main concepts and things that I intend to put into practice:
- MVC architecture.
- SOLID.
- Consume a RESTful JSON API that provide videos and images.
- Modular app, being more specific, to create an app using the package [flutter_modular](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular).
- Use the package [flutter_mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_mobx) for state management.
- Unit testing
