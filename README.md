# test-modular-app-video-image-api
Project created with the goal of put some concepts learned into practice. The app will display videos and image from Pixels (https://www.pexels.com/), using their API.

Main concepts and things that I intend to put into practice:
- Modular App, being more specific, to create an app using the package flutter_modular.
- MVC architecture.
- Consume a RESTful JSON API that provide videos and images.
- Use the package flutter_mobx for state management.
